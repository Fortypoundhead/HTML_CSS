<h2>Testimonials</h2>


<p>I hate to toot my own horn.  So here are what some other folks are saying about me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
Derek was our 'go-to' Systems Engineer for all Microsoft platforms. His in-depth knowledge of MS Operating Systems and analytical skills kept our regional systems operational. Derek was operational team lead for Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor but his influence extended to all Puget Sound, including Oak Harbor, Everett, Bremerton and Fort Lewis. He remained an integral team member throughout his tenure and after departing I monitored his progress and happiness at his new company because I wanted him back on our team. His value cannot be understated.
